This repository contains the source for a C written GNU/Linux-compatible game called spacewar

### spacewar

The spacewar project started as a college assignment.
Currently, it needs a graphics library provided by the professor to run. Valgrind also picks up numerous errors, which were not noticed at the time by the authors, since they didn't even know how to use valgrind at the time the classes were taking place.

##### Future goals

- Use a different library for increased portability.

- Perhaps redo the entire graphical module in order to remove bugs and errors.

- Make the program multi-threaded, an attempt to solve keyboard issues.

Add gaming features later
